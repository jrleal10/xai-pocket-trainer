Anotações pessoais para a entrevista com Jeffrey Weichsel, coisas que gosto:


## Sobre Equities:
"Jeffrey, regarding the 'Credit vs. Equity' distinction, I approach it through the lens of the Modigliani-Miller theorem—First Principles.
At the end of the day, value is created on the Left Side of the Balance Sheet (The Assets). Whether I am holding the Debt claim or the Equity claim (the Right Side), my job is to analyze if the company's assets are actually generating cash flow efficiently.
So, when I analyze a company, I am capital-structure agnostic. I focus on ROIC (Return on Invested Capital). If the ROIC is healthy, the company creates value. Whether that value flows to me as interest (Credit) or dividends/growth (Equity) is just a matter of hierarchy in the waterfall.
This implies that I can teach Grok to analyze the business fundamentals, not just the stock ticker. A Credit analyst who ignores the Asset side goes broke; an Equity analyst who ignores it is just gambling."

"Jeffrey, regarding fundamental ratios: I don't just memorize them; I stress-test them.
At Banco ABC, I led a project to validate our internal rating model. We were using 7 standard fundamental ratios. I ran a regression of these ratios against 10 years of actual default data.
The result? I proved that 2 of those 'textbook' ratios had zero correlation with default—they were just noise. We cut them and built a cleaner model using only the 5 predictive ratios.
Furthermore, I designed the workflow so the model gave a quantitative output, but the human analyst could override it if they provided a structured justification. This is essentially RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) applied to credit: using human intuition to catch edge cases the model missed.



## O **"Safety Check"**:
"Since transitioning out of the partnership at Joule to focus on this, I’ve set up a fully private, secure home office to ensure I can work on xAI's proprietary data with zero compliance risk."


## Para fechar:
Jeffrey: "Do you have any questions for me?"
Você (A Pergunta de Fechamento):
"Jeffrey, I know we have limited time. Based on my background in and my conversations with Adriana and Michael, I am confident I can bring the rigor you need for Grok. Is there any final hesitation on your end that I can address right now?"
"Jeffrey, I know we have limited time, so let me ask directly: based on my 5 years of fundamental analysis at Joule and my experience validating financial models at ABC, I'm confident I can contribute to your current projects immediately. Is there anything about my background that concerns you, or any question I can address right now?"
"Jeffrey, I want to make sure I've addressed everything. Is there anything about my fit for the role that I haven't covered?"
